When I first started five years ago, there were five sanitarians. In the last four years, two of the original five retired and one moved into the open division manager position. Within these three open slots, we have had seven different sanitarians throughout the four years. This is an extremely high turnover rate. I have felt extremely discouraged at times feeling like I am constantly in ""training mode"", which takes much more time, effort, and energy than having experienced sanitarians. Additionally, our department has experienced frequent understaffing when these positions were open. For almost a year, our department was staffed at less than 50% with two sanitarians and a supervisor (full staffing being five sanitarians and a supervisor). This was a very stressful time in our office and left our department feeling quite burnt out. The only positive was the team we did have was a strong team and we were able to work well together and get things done fairly well as a team as well as individually.","Good","Strongly Agree","Disagree","Agree","Disagree","I have one or more symptoms of burnout that won't go away","Yes","Insurance provider,Workplace,Montana Public Health Training Center - Wellness Program",NA,"Yes","Sound therapy,Wellness Champions Program,Virtual training,In-person training,Guided meditation",NA,"Yes","Other (please specify)","Move to different state, but remain in public health (unsure if government or non-government)","better opportunities outside the agency,job satisfaction,lack of opportunities for advancement,leadership changeover,organizational climate / culture,pay,reasons unrelated to my job,satisfaction with your supervisor,stress,weakening of benefits,work overload / burnout",NA,NA,NA,"I am not planning to retire before 2030","Woman",NA,"White",NA,37,"Other associate degree (please specify),BS/BA,I am currently pursuing a degree","Veterinary Technology",NA,NA,NA,NA,"MPH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No",NA,NA,"Registered Environmental Health Specialist / Registered Sanitarian (REHS / RS)",NA,"Yes","Certified Professional - Food Safety (CP-FS) and/or Certified Foodborne Outbreak Investigator,Certified in Public Health (CPH)",NA,"Bachelors","Non-supervisor","Non-supervisor","after 2030","leaving not retiring","Chronic or Complete","Disagree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Disagree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","Disagree","Disagree","Sometimes","Usually/Always","Usually/Always","Rarely/Never","Usually/Always","Usually/Always","Usually/Always","Usually/Always","Region 1 and 2","Bachelors or higher","35-44","35-54",5,"5-9","not satisfied with job","leaving OR retiring"
